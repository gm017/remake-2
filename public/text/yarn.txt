YARN SIREN BLARES LOUDER THAN BEFORE
YOUR FACE LOOKING LIKE A LIVING KIDNEY GIVES UP
ONE LAST GO ON THE AEGIS MINI
A FINAL CHECK WITH THE TORCH
...
BACK TO THE DENIA MARINA
GO ONCE IN 2002 AND ONCE IN THE FUTURE
CHURNED UP IN A FIGURE OF EIGHT
SWIM UP!!
...
I GATHER THEM ALL
FROM THE BOXING GYM
TO THE CREMATORIUM
TO THE ONE O CLOCK CLUB
TO THE CEMETARY
...
MOVE ON
LET ME SHOW YOU ROUND THE ARRIETA
HERES WHERE YOU SLEEP
AND
HERES WHERE YOU SLEEP IF ITS TOO HOT DOWN THERE
THE FIREWORKS WILL GO ON TIL LATE
CAREFUL NOT TO GET HIT
YES IT'S NOT A RATIONAL FEAR
YOU ARE RIGHT!
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
...
YOU HAVE DO THE CLICHE THING
WHERE THE STRUCTURE AT THE START
OPENS UP AT THE END
IN AN OBVIOUS LOOP
GET CHURNED UP AGAIN
...
MOVE ON
...
LEAVE OUR NORMAL LIFE
LOOK AT THE POSTERS
AND THE JEWELLERY
THNK ABOUT THE GUYS
BEADS NEXT TO 12K OF STAINLESS STEEL
YOU CANT ACCOUNT FOR TASTE
THEY WILL END UP HERE TO SO DON'T JOKE
